# Homework-Weather-Dashboard
## Description
This homework assignment required us to create an application that retrieves weather data and a forecast for cities using data from the OpenWeather One Call API along with Javascript, HTML and CSS (I used Bootstrap for styling).


We were given these accepence criteria:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

  
- **What was your motivation?**
For this assignment, my motivation was to allow a user to search their city and get important weather information. 
  
- **Why did you build this project?**
We built this project to get more comfortable with fetching API data and appending it to the screen using Javascript.

- **What problem does it solve?**
This allows users to check the weather. We were given the following user story:
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

- **What did you learn?**
I learned how to call an API and parse specific data, as well as how to allow a user input to call specific data. This was also good practice with appending the data and looping.

- **What challenges did you encounter?**
Getting the API data and using Javascript to append and save to local storage took the majority of the time. Functionality works but could have used more styling with more time.
